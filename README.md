# Finding_Donors
In this project, I used several supervised algorithms to model individual's income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. census (The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). My goal was to construct a model that accurately predicts whether someone makes more than $50K. This kind of task can help some organizations, e.g., church or charity group, to identify potential donors.
